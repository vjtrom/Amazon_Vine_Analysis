# Amazon_Vine_Analysis
## Overview of the Analysis:

In the area of product customer reviews, certain biases can skew results. Biases can come in many forms, including demographics, product specifics such as size and color, if something was purchased on sale, use or purpose, etc. In this example, we are trying to ascertain if there is a bias between paid reviews and unpaid reviews.

## Results: 
**How many Vine reviews and non-Vine reviews were there?**
- There were 285 Vine (paid reviews) and 31,452 non-Vine (unpaid reviews)

**How many Vine reviews were 5 stars? How many non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?**
- 163 Vine reviews were 5-star
- 14,603 non-Vine reviews were 5-star

**What percentage of Vine reviews were 5 stars? What percentage of non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?**
- 57% of Vine reviews were 5-star
- 46% of non-Vine reviews were 5-star

## Summary:  
Based on the results for this dataset, there is positivity bias for reviews in the Vine program. This is evidenced by the higher percentage of 5-star reviews for Vine versus non-Vine.

An additional analysis that would help interpret the results would be to use a statistical program like R and conduct a t-test to see if and how much there are statistically meaningful differences.
